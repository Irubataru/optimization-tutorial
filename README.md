# Optimizing your cloud

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Irubataru/optimization-tutorial/main?labpath=Tutorial.ipynb)

In this tutorial we will try to optimize our cloud storage and in the process explore some concepts and methods in the
field of optimization. We will look at brute force methods, simple heuristics, model building, and if there is time an
iterative approach. Tutorial will be given in python using a jupyter notebook.
